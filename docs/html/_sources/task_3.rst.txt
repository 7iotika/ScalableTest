Task 3. Text Editing
============================

Plans
-----

**Plans** is a feature that provides Product clients with a variety of service options based on their score.

The feature implementation adds a set of additional attributes to a user's record (see details in the :ref:`latest version of API reference <task_2>`). These attributes essentially represent the actual flow of user states (see the :ref:`flow description <task_1>`).

Please note that the feature implementation requires an extensive system update. As a result of the update, your customer service flow and solutions may be slightly modified. For example, users can be placed in an "idle" state before they confirm their purchase of a plan.

The number of plans available for each provider is not limited, so feel free to create as many plans as you need and customize them to your liking.
