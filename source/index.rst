Test Assignment for Scalable Solutions
============================================

Here you can find three assignments for the role of technical writer at Scalable Solutions:
   
.. toctree::
    :titlesonly:

    task_1
    task_2
    task_3


However, seems like all 3 parts of the assignment assemble a complete description of a single feature, "Plans". So in the real document, the text fron the 3rd task (the descriprional one) will be the 1st part, followed by the 1st task (which is not actually an architecture, but the algorithm description), and the API reference will come last.
